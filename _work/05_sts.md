discription: "What is at risk when we accept a social construct as inherent? Amidst rapid changes in the ways we communicate and digest information, phenomena that have in the past appeared as naturalized or accidental now demand a heightened self-consciousness and scrutiny. It is dangerous not to question the rules we live by. However it is the rapidity of change itself, rather than the long-standing presentation of behavior as accidental that generates a need for agency. If we can collectively accept that norms are fluid and malleable according to time and place, whose responsibility is it to ensure that norms are leveraged equitably?"

The development of a pop-up environment enabled the use of surveillance to record visitorsâ€™ responses to a series of decisions they are confronted by upon entering an inviting space. The environment plays on norms associated with public spaces, private information, artificial intelligence, and casual dialogue.
