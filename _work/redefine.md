discription: "What is at risk when we accept a social construct as inherent? Amidst rapid changes in the ways we communicate and digest information, phenomena that have in the past appeared as naturalized or accidental now demand a heightened self-consciousness and scrutiny. It is dangerous not to question the rules we live by. However it is the rapidity of change itself, rather than the long-standing presentation of behavior as accidental that generates a need for agency. If we can collectively accept that norms are fluid and malleable according to time and place, whose responsibility is it to ensure that norms are leveraged equitably?"
