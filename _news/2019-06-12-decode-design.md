Here's Jarrett from the interview:

> I define design as ‘ideology made artefact’. It’s the physical manifestation of particular ideologies. I think a lot about this line from French philosopher Louis Althusser's essay Ideology and the Ideological State Apparatus where he writes that: “ideology does not obscure reality but rather creates a new reality.”

> My reading of this is that ideologies don’t keep us from seeing the ‘real’ world but rather recreates the world in its image. This happens — this move from ideology to reality — through design. Design actualises ways of seeing the world.
