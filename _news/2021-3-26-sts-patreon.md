summary: "Scratching the Surface relaunches the membership program on Patreon."
---

We’re excited to announce that you can now support Scratching the Surface through Patreon. Replacing the previous membership program, becoming a patron gives you immediate access to bonus content including a monthly newsletter, exclusive interviews, full-episode transcripts and more. Plus, you help make Scratching the Surface sustainable and help support its production.

Three new tiers. Three ways to show support:

### STUDENTS
We’re now offering a new, cheaper support tier just for you. For just $3 a month, you’ll continue to get access to all the bonus content and I’ll do a 1:1 virtual coffee with you if you’d like to talk about work, design, criticism — whatever you’d like.

### SUPERFANS!
The new special Superfans tier, for $10 a month, includes early access to episodes, free or discounted entry to future events (in-person or virtual, like our Eye on Design x Scratching the Surface symposium last November), and the option to participate in quarterly virtual office hours with me. We’ll be building out that tier with some more special features over the next few months.

### OFFICIAL PATRON
And finally, for everyone in between we have our new Official Patron tier. Much like our old memberships, for just $5 a month, you’ll get our monthly newsletter with episode previews, links from former guests, and book recommendations as well as access to everything on Patreon.

In October, Scratching the Surface will turn five years old and hit 200 episodes. I can’t believe it’s come this far — I owe a lot to you. I thank you for your continued support (and the dialogue and conversations that have come from it) and hope you continue to want to support me and my work going forward, over on Patreon.
