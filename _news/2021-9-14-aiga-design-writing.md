As part of the 2021 AIGA Design Conference, Jarrett co-organized a workshop with Liz Stinson for Eye on Design called “Design Writing 101: How Writing Is a Lot More Like Designing Than You Think”. The 2 hour workshop features short presentations from myself and Liz, a panel discussion featuring Aggie Toppins, Anne Quito, and Molly Heintz, and a participatory workshop on interviewing and writing.
