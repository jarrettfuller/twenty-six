With a deep respect for humanity, speakers in the Latham Series address contemporary and cutting-edge topics in design. In 2022–23, ID’s Latham Fellow is Jarrett Fuller, who will be sharing the latest chapter about design and ID to mark ID’s 85th anniversary and contribute to the ID@85: 85 Years of Making the Future effort. His contributions will be in the form of Season 2 of the With Intent podcast and other materials to come starting Spring 2023.
