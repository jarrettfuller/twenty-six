In many ways, I feel like the quantity and quality of design books has never been higher. The height of my “to-read” stacks is growing much, much faster than my “read” stack, and it seems that ratio will only get worse. There is a flood of new design books coming in the next few months that look to be important, informative, and engaging additions to any bookshelf. Collected here are five new books I’m enjoying, and know I’ll be returning to again and again.
