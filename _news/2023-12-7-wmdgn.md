Jarrett Fuller was awarded the 2022-2023 Latham Fellowship at the Institute of Design (ID) at Illinois Tech. Coinciding with the school's 85th anniversary, Jarrett proposed a series of roundtable discussions and interviews about the present and future of design education, practice, and theory. 

The result was six roundtables with ID faculty that were turned into a podcast series, an online archive, and this book, which was published by Oro Editions in December 2023. 

twenty-six edited and designed the book, which is available wherever books are sold.
