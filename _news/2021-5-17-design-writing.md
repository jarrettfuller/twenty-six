The Design History Society, based in London England, has announced Jarrett Fuller as the guest judge for their 2021 Design Writing Prize. [From their website](https://www.designhistorysociety.org/awards/design-writing-prize):

> In order to encourage, recognise, and support writing that engages audiences in critical and contemporary issues in design writing, the Design History Society initiated a new writing prize in 2017. Running for the fifth time in 2021, this prize is open to scholars, researchers, critics, practitioners and educators within and outside the Society who demonstrate a commitment to furthering the work of critical debate in design through writing. The aim of the Design Writing Prize, in addition to promoting and celebrating excellent new work, is to advocate writing as a necessary and creative practice for communicating ideas related to design. In this vein, entries that include a variety of modes such as essays, interviews, reviews or editorial commentary are welcome and can either be published works or in manuscript phase.

To announce the appointment, Jarrett was interviewed by Fiona Anderson for the DHS Podcast.
