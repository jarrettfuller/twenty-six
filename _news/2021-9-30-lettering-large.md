Lettering Large is collaboration between the US Mission to the UAE and the American University of Sharjah at Expo 2020 Dubai. The 125 square meter mural combines both Arabic and English typography in a lenticular design featuring the phrase You and I seek to forge a limited universe, written by Emirati author Eman Al Yousuf. We designed the English composition and the Arabic side was designed by UA designer Nada AlYafei. The design was on view in the EUA from October 14, 2021 to March 31, 2022.
