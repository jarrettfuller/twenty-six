discription: The Facebook Global Marketing Solutions Summit is an annual internal sales conference held in San Francisco, CA. In 2015, Jarrett led the design of the conference's identity, based on the theme "Redefine." Drawing on ideas around innovation and process, we created an evolving visual identity that included both the work the attendees were doing at Facebook and innovators throughout history who have redefined their fields.

Instead of a static logo, we asked every attendee to write the word "redefine" in their own handwriting. We used these submissions to create an evolving identity where the logo was written in a different person's handwriting throughout the event. These 'logos' were then paired with duotone images of innovators through history.
