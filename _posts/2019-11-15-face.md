discription: "Jessica Helfand's 2019 book, <i>Face: A Visual Odyssey</i> is a highly illustrative look at the face, both in historically and in contemporary, that asks what it means to be photographed, how are we identified and what does it mean to be human? Working closely with Jessica, twenty-six developed a visual framework to house Jessica's text and the hundreds of images included in the book. We designing a dense yet refined book that is both visually engaging and intellectually stimulating."
