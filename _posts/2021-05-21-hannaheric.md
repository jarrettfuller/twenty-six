discription: "A simple, typographic-forward design system for a rustic spring wedding. We worked closely with the couple to create a typographic hierarchy for display content across print and digital assets as well as custom illlustrations. After the wedding was postponed due to COVID-19, we developed a playful redesign to invite guests to the new event."
