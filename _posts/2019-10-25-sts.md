discription: "Since 2016, Jarrett Fuller has hosted and produced Scratching the Surface, a weekly podcast about design criticism and practice. In October 2019, to celebrate the show's third anniversary, we launched a full redesign of the podcast's website, optimizing for the large archive of episodes while setting up additional initiatives that may come in the future."
