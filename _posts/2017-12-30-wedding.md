discription: "On June 3, 2018, Jarrett got married to his long-time girlfriend Eurry. The ceremony took place at the John James Audubon Center, the former home of the famed naturalist and bird painter. We used Audubon's famous paintings as the centerpiece for the design and built a flexible system around them ranging from invitations to nametags to decorations."

<div class="right"><h3>Invitations</h3>For the invitations that went out a few months later, we started incorporating Audubon's images in a fold-out poster on the back of the invitation that collages the state birds from notable locations in Eurry and Jarrett's lives: where they were born, where they met, where they were getting married, and where they live now. What starts as a simple black and white invite, unfolds into an 18x20 full-color poster</div>

<div class="right"><h3>Decorations</h3>Custom table cards were designed, again incorporating Audubon's paintings. For the nametags, small iconography was created to help the servers know what dishes went where. We also gifted every guest with a small box of our favorite gummi bears, complete with a custom label.</div>
