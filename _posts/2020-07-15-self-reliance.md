discription: "A reimagining of Ralph Waldo Emerson's classic essay on self-reliance, edited it for a contemporary audience, and presented it in a covetable pocket-book format intended to be read, carried, consulted and to inspire throughout our new daily lives. Framed for the 21st century and with current events in play, editor Jessica Helfand highlights moments in the text that will resonate most with those seeking creative inspiration, greater self-belief and acceptance of oneâ€™s independence in an interconnected world. twenty-six worked with frequent collaborator Jessica Helfand on concept development and visual design."
