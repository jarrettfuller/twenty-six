discription: "To celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of Design Observer, we worked with Michael Bierut, Jessica Helfand, and MIT Press to design and edit a book collecting some of the site's best essays. In addition to designing and co-editing the book, Jarrett conducted an interview with Michael and Jessica that serves as the book's introduction. Culture is Not Always Popular will be available from MIT Press in November. More images coming soon."
