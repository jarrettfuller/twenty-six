<h3>The Studio</h3>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Jarrett Fuller, twenty-six design is a multidiscplinary design and editorial studio that mixes client work with self-initiated projects based in Brooklyn, NY. Our work takes shape across a variety of media, from books and websites to podcasts and installations and we work with clients large and small, around the world.</p>

<p>In addition to client work, we also produce experimental work, research projects, and original content. This includes Scratching the Surface, a weekly design criticism podcast; Graphic Design Readings, an online archive of canonical graphic design texts; and other books and speculative projects.</p>
